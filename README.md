# Memory Card Game

## Introduction

This project is meant to be a practice in writing functional components and an assessment, finding out if I've understood the concepts surrounding Hooks.

## Goals and Objectives

- Create a memory card game application
- The app should include a scoreboard, which counts the current and best score
- Each card should display an image and possibly some informational text
- There should be a function that displays the cards in a random order anytime a user clicks on one

## How to Play

Whenever the user clicks a card that has never been clicked before, a point is added and the position of the cards changes. If a card is clicked twice, the game resets and the best score is recorded.

## Skills Emphasized in this Project

- Functional Components
- React Hooks
- React concepts in general
- Non-mutating array methods
- Grid & Flexbox

## Thoughts After Completion

I've enjoyed planning this project since it involved one of my favorite cartoons, Gravity Falls. I've also understood more about the concept of useEffect Hook, and where states are better placed and how to preserve them. Working in this project made me realize that I still got a long way to go when it comes to React because there are Hooks that I haven't even read and used yet.
